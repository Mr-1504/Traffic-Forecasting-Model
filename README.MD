# Traffic Forecasting Model

## Introduction

Traffic forecasting is a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems, enabling efficient traffic flow management, congestion reduction, and improved road safety. This model leverages machine learning techniques to predict traffic flow based on historical data and related factors.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-1504/Traffic-Forecasting-Model.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd Traffic-Forecasting-Model
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the data**:

   - Collect historical traffic data from reliable sources.
   - Ensure the data is correctly formatted and stored in the `resource/` directory.

2. **Train the model**:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Make predictions**:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input your_input_data.csv --output your_output_predictions.csv
   ```
